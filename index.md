# Open Spec for Frameworks 


A standard specification for writing frameworks has become commonplace in today's organizations. The primary motivation behind this standardization is to enhance interoperability during integrations. Different organizations have implemented various standardization practices, some of which are outlined below:

* API Structure - The recommended API structure consists of three main components: "status," "data," and "error." The error component provides a more comprehensive definition of error codes compared to what HTTP typically offers. This structure can also be extended to proto-bufs for added flexibility.
* Request Tracing - While numerous techniques exist for request tracing, a fundamental standard is to ensure that every request includes a "request_id" header or query parameter. This practice helps track and monitor requests efficiently.
* Processing Waterfall - Many organizations employ Application Performance Monitoring (APMs) for processing waterfall analysis. However, APMs may not be scalable in certain situations. Therefore, it is crucial to incorporate measurability at every step of execution and emit metrics that can be easily observed and analyzed.
* Cache Management - Standardizing cache management practices ensures optimized and consistent handling of caching in frameworks.

These specifications aim to streamline the integration process between different systems, ultimately reducing the time it takes to merge them. By fostering a common approach across systems, we hope to create more efficient and sustainable technology solutions.
