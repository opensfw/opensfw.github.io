## Why are we embarking on this journey?

### Enhancing Industry Consistency - (Reducing Integration Overhead)
Within our industry, valuable hours are dedicated to crafting adapters that translate API definitions from one system (X) into another (Y). Imagine if both systems adhered to a shared specification. The integration process would shift its focus to bolstering business logic, driving efficiency and minimizing redundant work.

### Fostering Interoperability and Extensibility
A future where software systems converse in a common language holds exciting potential. This alignment could pave the way for heightened abstraction, akin to the revolutionary impact of virtualization layers in the past. Just as Kubernetes transformed application hosting and facilitated multi-cloud adoption, our specification could similarly reshape possibilities. Systems adhering to this specification would unlock a realm of choices for engineers, empowering them to fluidly select the most suitable frameworks, unconstrained by compatibility concerns.

### Advancing Sustainability
Imagine the collective impact when a substantial portion of systems communicate through this standardized specification. Swift improvements and enhancements would propagate effortlessly, bolstering system efficiency and ultimately leading to reduced compute cycles â€“ a direct pathway to curbing carbon footprint. By uniting under a shared banner, we amplify the potential to make lasting positive changes for our environment and industry as a whole.


### Productivity
Establishing industry-wide common standards among developers holds the potential to significantly enhance productivity. Simplified onboarding processes and streamlined service/application launches would be among the direct benefits. Furthermore, this initiative could offer improved resource management, particularly from a security and compliance perspective.
